# Challenges
This was the first application I created that implemented full CRUD functionality across campsites and reviews. Yelp Camp was created using MongoDB and I learned a lot about querying the database for specific pieces of data and interested me to learn other popular database systems like SQL. I also learned a lot about running middleware across all routes of the application to implement authorisation and authentication of user accounts. The most challenging aspect of the application, however, was facing many errors in the code, especially with implementing a lot express packages. Ultimately, I gained a lot of experience debugging and I feel this greatly improved my problem-solving skills with getting the app up and running.
